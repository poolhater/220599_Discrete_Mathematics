Note that file name is knpr.l and .knp is extension
Use the file as [ .l ] extension. (Check for .l.txt)
We can get C analyser by using flex 
Save the Flex specification to a file named knpr.l.
Run flex -o knpr.c knpr.l to get a C analyser file.
Compile the new C analyser like gcc -o knpr knpr.c -lfl 
Run with input as ./knpr < input.knp. Results in tokens.
Sometimes it is showing error then repeat the steps again.
