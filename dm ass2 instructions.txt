	Note that file name is knpr.l and .knp is extension
	Use the file as [ .l ] extension. (Check for .l.txt)
	We can get C analyser by using flex 
	Check if the file is named as knpr.l.
	Run flex -o knpr.c knpr.l to get a C analyser file.
	Compile the new C analyser like gcc -o knpr knpr.c -lfl 
	Run with input as ./knpr < input.knp.
